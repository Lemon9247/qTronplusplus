# qTron++
## A particle wavefunction simulator written in C++

Watch this space! I haven't started this yet, but I will soon...

The aim of qTron++ will be to model the time evolution of a particle's wavefunction in the presence of any arbitrary potential. It'll probably stick with the ground state, but that could change!
